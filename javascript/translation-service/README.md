# Translation Service

Welcome to Translation Service on Exercism's JavaScript Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

The [`Promise` object][mdn-promise] represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

> Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

A `Promise` has three states:

1. unresolved
2. resolved
3. rejected

When a `Promise` is _settled_, it means that it has either _resolved_ or _rejected_.

## Guarantees

Unlike old-fashioned _passed-in_ callbacks, a promise comes with some guarantees, including, but not limited to:

- A `Promise` can only change its state _once_, which means that a resolved promise can never become rejected.
- Callbacks added with [`.then`][mdn-promise-then] are called even if the promise has already settled.
- Multiple callback may be added using [`.then`][mdn-promise-then], and those callbacks will be invoked in the order as they were inserted.

## Chaining

> TODO: `.then`, `.catch`

## Constructing

> TODO: `Promise.resolve` `Promise.reject` `new Promise(resolve, reject)`

## Instructions

In this exercise you'll be providing a `TranslationService` where paid members have some quality assurance.

You have found an out-of-space translation API that is able to fulfill any translation _request_ in a reasonable amount of time, and you want to capitalize on this.

## The API interface

The API has a very minimal interface:

### Fetching a translation

`api.fetch(text)` fetches the translation of `text`, returning two values:

- `translation`: the actual translation
- `quality`: the quality expressed as a number

If there is no translation available (because it has not been requested yet, see below), the API throws a `NotAvailable` error.
An `Untranslatable` error is thrown if a piece of text is untranslatable.

```javascript
api.fetch('jIyaj');
// => Promise({ resolved: 'I understand' })
```

### Requesting a translation

Some translations are known in the future.
The API knows about these.
That's the difference between `NotAvailable` (will be available, but must be requested) and `Untranslatable` (will never be available).

`api.request(text, callback)` requests the translation of `text`, calling the `callback` once it's ready, without a value, only indicating that it is now available.

> This API is _unstable_, which means that sometimes the API will fail and call the `callback` with an error.
> If that happens, it is okay to re-request.

```javascript
api.request('majQa’');
// => Promise({ resolved: undefined })
```

### ⚠ Warning! ⚠

```exercism/caution
The API works its magic by teleporting in the various translators when a `request` comes in.
This is a very costly action, so it shouldn't be called when a translation *is* available.
Unfortunately not everyone reads the manual, so there is a system in place to kick-out bad actors.

If a `api.request` is called for `text` is available, the API throws an `AbusiveClientError` for this call, **and every call after that**.
Ensure that you *never* request a translation if something has already been translated.
```

## 1. Fetch a translation, ignoring the quality

Implement a function `free(text)` to fetch a translation, ignoring the quality, and forwarding any errors thrown by the API:

- Returns the translation if it can be retrieved, regardless its quality
- Forwards any error from the translation API

```javascript
service.free('jIyaj');
// => Promise<...> resolves "I understand."

service.free("jIyajbe'");
// => Promise<...> rejects Error("Not yet translated")
```

## 2. Fetch a batch of translations, all-or-nothing

Implement a function `batch([text, text, ...])` that translates the given texts using the free service, returning all the translations, or a single error.

- Resolves with all the translations (in the same order), if they are all available
- Rejects with the first error that is encountered
- Rejects with a `BatchIsEmpty` error if no texts are given

```javascript
service.batch(['jIyaj', "majQa'"]);
// => Promise<...> resolves ["I understand.", "Well done!"]

service.batch(['jIyaj', "jIyajbe'"]);
// => Promise<...> rejects new Error("Not yet translated")

service.batch([]);
// => Promise<...> rejects BatchIsEmpty()
```

## 3. Request a translation, retrying at most 2 times

Implement a function `request(text)` that _requests_ a translation, with automatic retries, up to a total of **3 calls** for the same request.

- If `api.request` does not return an error, resolve with `undefined`
- If `api.request` returns an error, retry at most two times
- If you're out of retires, reject with the last error received

```javascript
service.request("jIyajbe'");
// => Promise<...> resolves (with nothing), can now be retrieved using the fetch API
```

## 4. Fetch a translation, inspect the quality, or request it

Implement the function `premium(text, quality)` for premium users, which fetches a translation, request it if it's not available, and only returns it if it meets a certain threshold.

- If `api.fetch` resolves, check the quality before resolving
- If `api.fetch` rejects with `NotAvailable`, _request_ the translation instead
- If `api.fetch` rejects with `Untranslatable`, forward the error
- If _requesting_ rejects, forward the error

```javascript
service.premium("jIyajbe'", 100);
// => Promise<...> resolves "I don't understand."

service.premium("'arlogh Qoylu'pu'?", 100);
// => Promise<...> rejects QualityThresholdNotMet()

service.premium("'arlogh Qoylu'pu'?", 40);
// => Promise<...> resolves "What time is it?"
```

## N.B.

```exercism/note
The correct translation of `'arlogh Qoylu'pu'?` is **How many times has it been heard?**.
```
